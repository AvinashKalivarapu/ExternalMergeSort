--> Implemented the two-phase merge sort algorithm to sort large number of records
--> External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device
(usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive).


USAGE:
g++ -std=c++0x ExternalMergeSort.cpp
